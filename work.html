    Systems Software Research Assistant
  </h2>

  <p>
    Since August 2025, I have worked as a Systems Software Research Assistant at the University of South Florida’s Interface Research Lab (IRL), building performance-critical arithmetic modules in RISC-V assembly and Python for AI inference on resource-constrained devices, improving simulated throughput by 57%. I also developed automated benchmarking, testing, and validation pipelines that reduced manual testing time by 40%.
  </p>

  <p>
    I partner closely with researchers to translate low-level architecture requirements into reusable software, accelerating iteration on energy-efficient edge AI systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    From January 2025 to August 2025, I served as a Research Assistant in the USF Computational Social Science and AI Lab, building React + TypeScript experiment interfaces that improved participant data-capture reliability by 25%. I refined input collection to cut data errors by 32% and connected the chatbox UI to backend model endpoints for responsive AI-driven conversations.

    Admissions Data Analyst & Student Operations
  </h2>

  <p>
    From May 2024 to August 2025, I worked with International Admissions at the University of South Florida as an Admissions Data Analyst and International Student Ambassador, supporting analytical workflows and student-facing services.
  </p>

  <p>
    I queried, reconciled, and analyzed 50+ daily international admissions records across Banner and Dynamics using SQL, identifying inconsistencies and process bottlenecks while maintaining 100% accuracy. I coordinated intake, documentation, and communication for 500+ international students, improving case resolution efficiency and service quality.
  </p>

  <p>
    I diagnosed cross-departmental escalation delays and redesigned emergency case routing across four units, reducing response time by 30% and improving service continuity. I also validated data updates and process changes before release to ensure accuracy and compliance.

       <p>
        From June 2024 to September 2024, I participated in NASA L'SPACE NPWEE Academy as a Technical Research Intern, collaborating with an 11-member team to organize design data, support simulation planning, and coordinate testing cycles for a habitat research prototype.
       </p> 
       <p>
        I automated portions of the team’s analysis workflow using Python scripts, reducing manual data-processing time by 15% and standardizing output formats for design evaluations.
       </p>
       <p>
        I assessed preliminary project proposals for feasibility and documentation quality as part of the program’s review panel.
