    Research Assistant
  </h2>

  <p>
    I currently serve as a Research Assistant at the University of South Florida’s Interface Research Lab (IRL), where I collaborate with faculty to design energy-efficient architectures using the Residue Number System (RNS). My work focuses on developing RNS-based arithmetic units in SystemVerilog to improve computational performance while reducing power consumption. I also design in-memory computing prototypes that accelerate low-power AI hardware and build Python automation scripts to streamline RNS data conversion and system modeling.
  </p>

  <p>
    From January 2025 to August 2025, I worked as a Research Assistant at USF’s Computational Social Science and AI Lab. In this position, I collaborated with faculty to investigate how human–AI interactions shape creativity and social behavior. I developed interactive games and front-end interfaces to improve behavioral data collection efficiency by 25%, and contributed to building AI-driven recommendation models that analyzed semantic and network-structural patterns within social networks.
  </p>

  <p>
    Together, these experiences have allowed me to explore both the hardware and human dimensions of artificial intelligence—combining technical design, system optimization, and behavioral analysis to advance AI research across disciplines.

    Admissions Data Analyst & Ambassador
  </h2>

  <p>
    From May 2024 to August 2025, I worked with International Admissions at the University of South Florida as an Admissions Data Analyst and International Student Ambassador. In this role, I supported both the analytical and student-facing aspects of the admissions process, helping streamline operations while assisting incoming international students.
  </p>

  <p>
    I provided personalized guidance to more than 500 international applicants through in-person consultations, email, and phone, helping them navigate the admissions process and transition to USF. Using systems such as Dynamics and Banner, I maintained and updated over 100 SQL student databases daily with complete accuracy, ensuring data integrity and smooth communication between departments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Additionally, I improved emergency case management efficiency by leveraging SharePoint and coordinating across multiple teams—reducing response times by 30% and enhancing overall workflow effectiveness. This experience strengthened my skills in data management, collaboration, and cross-cultural communication, while deepening my appreciation for the intersection of technology and student support.

        Technical Researcher</i>
       </h2>
       <p> </p>
       <br>
       <p>
        During my participation in the NASA L'SPACE NPWEE Academy as a Techinal Researcher, I had the privilege of collaborating with a diverse team of 11 undergraduate students over a 12-week program. Our collective goal was to innovate and propose an "Inflatable Habitat" concept for potential use in future space flights, which we aimed to patent with NASA.
       </p> 
       <p>
        My role was primarily focused on conducting extensive research into materials suitable for the habitat's construction. This involved evaluating the structural integrity, durability, and adaptability of various materials to withstand the harsh conditions of space while ensuring safety and functionality for astronauts. By meticulously analyzing material properties and performance metrics, I provided critical insights that informed the design and feasibility of our proposal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout the program, I actively engaged in brainstorming sessions, prototype development, and simulations to refine our concept. Collaborating closely with team members from diverse academic backgrounds, I leveraged my expertise in materials science to contribute innovative solutions and ensure the viability of our proposal. Our collective efforts culminated in a comprehensive presentation to NASA, showcasing our research findings, design considerations, and the potential impact of our "Inflatable Habitat" concept on future space missions.
