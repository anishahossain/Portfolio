        Technical Researcher</i>
       </h2>
       <p>
        During my participation in the NASA L'SPACE NPWEE Academy as a Techinal Researcher, I had the privilege of collaborating with a diverse team of 11 undergraduate students over a 12-week program. Our collective goal was to innovate and propose an "Inflatable Habitat" concept for potential use in future space flights, which we aimed to patent with NASA.
       </p> 
       <p>
        My role was primarily focused on conducting extensive research into materials suitable for the habitat's construction. This involved evaluating the structural integrity, durability, and adaptability of various materials to withstand the harsh conditions of space while ensuring safety and functionality for astronauts. By meticulously analyzing material properties and performance metrics, I provided critical insights that informed the design and feasibility of our proposal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout the program, I actively engaged in brainstorming sessions, prototype development, and simulations to refine our concept. Collaborating closely with team members from diverse academic backgrounds, I leveraged my expertise in materials science to contribute innovative solutions and ensure the viability of our proposal. Our collective efforts culminated in a comprehensive presentation to NASA, showcasing our research findings, design considerations, and the potential impact of our "Inflatable Habitat" concept on future space missions.
