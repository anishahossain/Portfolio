       <h2>
        Who I am 
       </h2>
       <p>Born and raised in Bangladesh my early years were marked by a deep passion for the arts, 
        particularly painting, which led me to successfully sell my works and engage with the local art community. 
        I am also very interested in Video Games and have played Valorant competitively! From an early age, I was 
        captivated by the intricate worlds and mechanics of video games, which led me to explore the underlying technologies 
        that make these experiences possible. This fascination with gaming fueled my desire to understand and contribute to the
         development of innovative software and systems.</p>
         <p>I have a cat names Luna who is technically my daughter and I lover her a lot :)</p>
       <p>
        <p>
            I am fluent in English, Bengali, Hindi, and Urdu, with partial proficiency in Arabic. In my free time I love making projects  or hanging out with my friends going on side quests!
