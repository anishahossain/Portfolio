        Born and raised in Bangladesh, I completed my high school education at S.F.X Green Herald International School, where I developed a strong foundation for my future endeavors. My early years were marked by a deep passion for the arts, particularly painting, which led me to successfully sell my works and engage with the local art community. Beyond visual arts, I explored music by learning to play the harmonium and taking singing classes, further broadening my creative talents. Fluent in English, Bengali, Hindi, and Urdu, with partial proficiency in Arabic, I possess a rich linguistic and cultural background that enhances my ability to connect with diverse audiences. These experiences have not only shaped my personal growth but have also contributed to a well-rounded perspective that I bring to my professional pursuits.

        My journey into computer science was sparked by a profound passion for gaming. From an early age, I was captivated by the intricate worlds and mechanics of video games, which led me to explore the underlying technologies that make these experiences possible. This fascination with gaming fueled my desire to understand and contribute to the development of innovative software and systems. Pursuing a degree in computer science allows me to blend my enthusiasm for gaming with my technical skills, driving me to explore new advancements and create impactful solutions within the tech industry.

        I serve as the Vice President of the Bangladesh Student Association at USF. In this role, I support Bangladeshi students with academic, career, and personal advice. Previously, as a Student Coordinator, I organized events and activities to help students connect and build a community. Now, as Vice President, I continue to foster a supportive environment, offering one-on-one mentoring and organizing workshops on various topics, from resume building to stress management.
        My goal is to help my peers succeed and feel supported in all aspects of their university experience.
